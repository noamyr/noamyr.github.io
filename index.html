            <h1>About Noam Youngrak Son (less urgent)</h1>
            <div class="scroll-box">
                <p><a href="cv.html" target="_self">Noam Youngrak Son</a> is a communication designer, design theorist, and cultural worker. Their design
                    work encompasses small-scale publishing projects, workshops, lectures, writing, net art, and
                    occasional performative interventions. As a cultural worker, they have co-organized the Ghent-based
                    queer publishing collective <a href="https://bebebooks.be">Bebe Books</a> since 2021. Son has expanded their focus from design to
                    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBTyPORE_YEFztVhoPBXjRIsWXqfQjr7/view?usp=sharing">theory</a> in order to critically engage with the ontology of the design industry, media, and broader
                    material culture. This turn is informed by their observations of cultural assemblages that echo the
                    extractive operations of capitalism on racialized and more-than-human populations. They are
                    particularly attentive to the interconnected notions of speculation—both as an open artistic
                    approach and as a process of value increase in capitalism. They research the tendency of the former
                    in design to be subjugated by the latter and explore alternative methods for speculative design
                    practices to realize their transindividual potential through collective organization and workshop
                    facilitation. In this process, Son utilizes queer publishing as a technology for mobilizing
                    attention beyond the financialized “scarce resource” of the attention economy. In this context,
                    publishing extends beyond mere printed matter to encompass the maintenance of communities and the
                    cultivation of interspecies relationships. The term "queer" here is not used as a statement of
                    identity but as a process—small yet collective strategies of publishing that challenge the modern
                    myth of the heroic designer.</p>
